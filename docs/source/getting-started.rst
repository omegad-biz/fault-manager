Getting Started
===============

Fault Manager is a component build with a goal to provide a better exception management.

Initially, it was an internal *"feature"* of a project I'm working on, but thanks to
`@alextech <http://alex-tech-adventures.com/>`_ who suggested me to pack that feature as a stand-alone component and
put it in `GitHub <https://github.com/omegad-biz/fault-manager>`_, is now open-source and available to everybody.

Fault Manager is under `MIT license <https://github.com/omegad-biz/fault-manager/blob/master/LICENSE>`_, feel free to
use it and if you have any suggestions to improve it or if you want to get your hands dirty and add some functionality
into it, that you believe is currently missing, then feel free to do so! Don't forget to check the
`Contributing <https://github.com/omegad-biz/fault-manager/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ page!

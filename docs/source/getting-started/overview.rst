Overview and Features
=====================

With Fault Manager, you can easily throw or create already defined exceptions, either your own either PHP build in
exceptions.

Besides that, you are able to generate on-the-fly exceptions that do not exist yet, Fault Manager will
generate them for you thus they won't need to be generated next time you call them and also if you use an IDE, you'll
have code-hint support for custom generated exceptions as well.
